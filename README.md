Clinical Trial Simulation: Calculating Sample Size and Power for a New Drug Study.

## Project: Clinical Trial Power Analysis
Problem Statement:Before launching a Phase II trial for a new antihypertensive, we must determine the minimum number of participants required to achieve $80\%$ statistical power.

##### Tools Used:
Python: statsmodels and matplotlib.

##### Statistical Concepts:
Effect Size (Cohen's $d$), Significance Level ($\alpha$), and Power.

##### Takeaway:
For a medium effect size of $0.5$, the study requires roughly $64$ patients per arm (Treatment vs. Control) to avoid a Type II error.
